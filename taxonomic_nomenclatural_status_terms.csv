http://webprojects.huh.harvard.edu/ontologies/taxonomic_nomenclatural_status_terms.owl#Sanctioned_Name,"In Botanical Nomenclature the standard starting point is Linnaeus' Species Plantarum.  In the interests of stability, Mycologists have taken several measures over time to devalue early fungal names from the late 1700s and early 1800s.   Since the 1981 ICBN, two works, namely Persoon's 1801 Synopisis and Fries 1821-1832 Systema, have been granted a special status, in which a subset of the names adopted in these works are given a special protected priority.   Names adopted by Persoon for rusts, smuts and gastromycetes are automatically granted priority over earlier names.   Names found in Persoon and Fries are considered to be sanctioned names, created by their original authors, but sanctioned and given special protected status by Fr. or Pers. and this sanctioning is recognised by appending either :Fr. or :Pers. to the authorship of the name.

However,  between 1950 and 1981, three works later than Species Plantarum were set as the starting point for nomenclature of Fungi, and substantial complexity resulted.  One of these works was Freis published in three volumes from 1821 to 1832.  The date of Jan 1 1821 was considered to be the date of publication of this three volume work.  This left a set of fungal names that were validly published between 1821 and 1832 and which were adopted by Fries, the author of the three volume work, in volumes 2 or 3 in an awkward position (being both considerd as published by Fries in the starting point work in 1821, and actually first published by other authors after 1821, as well as the issue of who should be considered the author of earlier names addopted by Fries and Persoon.  Substantial disagreement existed over how  to handle these names, and the term Sanctioned name was proposed in this context, with the term and :Fr. authorship convention being later coopted by the 1981 code."
